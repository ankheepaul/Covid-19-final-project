# OVERVIEW
This repository contains code and the report for the statistical study undertaken 
to infer a relationship between the total number of Covid-19 cases in a country and socio-demographic variables of interest. It was created by Ankhee Paul. The purpose of this is to create a report that visualizes Covid-19 data obtained at a global level in different ways and runs a minor regression to receive initial results. The results of multiple models yielded a positive relationship between population and the number of Covid-19 cases tested every 1 million people with the response variable, the total number Covid-19 cases. The results are significant and can be generalized to the population level. The data that was used for anaylsis cannot be shared publicly although it is available for public use. Details on how to obtain this data is provided below. The sections of this repository are: Outputs


John Hopkins Covid-19 Data: The data was obtained from the data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). 
A clean version of the data has been obtained from Kaggle. To access the data used click on the following [link]( https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona- virus-report/discussionhttps://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus- report/discussion)

World Health Organization data: The merged datasets have been obtained from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory.
